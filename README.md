# Hand-Written-Digit-Classification-Project
## General Info
This project utilizes artificial neural networks (ANNs), which is a part of **deep learning**, implemented using TensorFlow and Keras API, to classify handwritten digits. The goal is to train a model that can accurately identify the digit represented in an image of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Through training, the model learns to map input images to their corresponding digit labels, enabling it to classify unseen handwritten digits with high accuracy.
## About the dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark dataset widely used for handwritten digit recognition tasks. It consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), along with their corresponding labels. MNIST is a popular dataset for beginners in machine learning and serves as a standard for evaluating the performance of various classification algorithms.
It has total 70k images. This dataset was inbuilt in the keras API. This dataset will be divided in 2 parts:

1. Training dataset : 60k images - 60k labels
2. Testing dataset : 10k images - 10k labels
## Classification Type:
It is a multi-class classification problem as there are 10 digits from 0-9 which the model needs to identify.
